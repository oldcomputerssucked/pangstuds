This is the game engine demo I developed in my gamedev episode "Making a game like it's 1993."

The intention was to make a game, I ran out of time however.

What's presented here is the tech demo I produce that technically could
become a game.

As this was developed as a part of making the video, I do not see it having
much value on its own. Thus, consider the source code release to be under
3-clause BSD.

This was developed in Turbo C++ 3.0, and you will additionally need the
XLib 6.0 and keyboard routines, available separately. You should find a link
on my website: https://oldcomputerssucked.com

The graphics was made in a shareware editor called "256paint", see my website
for a link to that.
